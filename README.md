📦 Smart Post-Harvest Monitoring System
##  Project Overview

The Smart Post-Harvest Monitoring System is an intelligent environmental monitoring solution designed to reduce post-harvest losses caused by improper storage conditions.

This system monitors temperature and humidity levels in storage facilities and provides real-time condition assessment and corrective recommendations.

##  Problem Statement

Post-harvest losses in developing countries occur due to:

Excess humidity leading to mold growth

High temperature accelerating spoilage

Poor ventilation and storage management

Small-scale farmers often lack affordable monitoring systems to maintain optimal storage conditions.
## Solution

This system:

Monitors temperature and humidity

Evaluates storage condition status

Provides warning alerts

Recommends corrective actions

Simulates manager notification messages

##  System Logic
Condition	Status
Humidity ≤ 65% & Temp ≤ 28°C	Normal
High Humidity	Action Needed
High Temperature	Action Needed
Both High	Immediate Action
## Technologies Used

C Programming Language

Environmental threshold logic

Time-based monitoring simulation

## Future Hardware Integration

Arduino Nano

DHT11 Sensor

LCD Display

Buzzer Alarm

GSM Module for SMS alerts
